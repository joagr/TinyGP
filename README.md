# TinyGP

A Rust implementation of Riccardo Poli's TinyGP:
	https://cswww.essex.ac.uk/staff/rpoli/TinyGP/
closely based on his Java version from here:
	https://cswww.essex.ac.uk/staff/rpoli/TinyGP/tiny_gp.java

This closely follows Riccardo's java code, so that this rust version
can easily be compared with the java version. I will do some variation
on this, but as a separate fork.

Please see Riccardo's web page for an overview and usage notes.
